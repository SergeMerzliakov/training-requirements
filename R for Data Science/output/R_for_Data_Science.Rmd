### Overview
This report details an analysis of the GapMinder data, containing various economic statistics for countries across the world, from 1962 to 2007

### Question 1 - Relationship Between Continents and Energy Use 

There was a distinct difference in energy use between continents, as there was a strong link between GDP Per Capita and energy usage (Graph 1). Continents with a lot of developed nations such as Europe and Oceania consistently had higher energy usage through the period 1962-2007. Energy usage also increased for most continents over time.

##### Issue 1: Missing Data in Oldest Records
From 1962 to 1967, both Americas and the Asian continents data only included developed nations such as USA, Canada and Japan, leading to very high median energy usages. From 1972, less developed nations energy usage data was added, leading to large drops in median energy usage for Asia and the Americas.

##### Issue 2: High variability of data by continent
A review of the energy use by continent revealed that several continents contained developed nations from the [G12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Twelve), all of which have much higher energy usage than developing nations. These nations represented outliers, making the median a better measure for all summary statistics.

The graphs below demonstrate the issue of developed and developing countries in Asia and the Americas for a single year.
